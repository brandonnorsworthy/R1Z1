NEW UPDATE FOR HDRP BRANCH
====================================
If your want to add this to your map for the upincoming HDRP update in MAY 
head over to Rust Edit Discord and Look for the Releases Channel. 
Version 1.1.37 Rust Edit will be the edittor for HDRP Branch.

To use new Editor you must install Rust staging from your Steam Directory then 
Right click the program from your steam games list and click Properties,
Change Beta to Aux01


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To add to your Map, just install the prefab files to Rust Edit / Custom Prefabs Folder!
Plop it down and apply the heights, splats, biomes, topology and alpha. and you should be good to go. 
Id recomend not breaking the prefab into seperate parts and leave it as is. By breaking the prefab from 
its group some prefabs will rotate and resize a bit.


This Pack is an update to Little Cabin, My most Downloaded Free Prefab.As such I have included another Update to the now Little Cabins.
It started with one normal Cabin in the forest and now has a christmas Version, and Swamp Version.

As most do not know I lost my Father to Stage 4 Brain Cancer back in 2018, 
We had no time to prepare for it, The doctors caught it late and he was given a few months to live. 
I donate periodically to this fundraiser so that others may have the chance I never had,
I want others to get more time with their love ones and if a single donation can help them live 
just a little easier and get even one more minute thats enough. Thanks again -Nox
