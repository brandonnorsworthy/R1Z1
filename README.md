Map Version To Be Developed:
Battle Royal
Survival

Survival version could stem off the BR version but add in a custom subway underground or trading posts/ custom monuments to compensate for the missing Rust Vanilla ones.

Design choices to be made:
•Cargo Ship:
 Turn map into island for Cargo Ship spawn
 Cut out entrance/exit for Cargo Ship and have it follow the ingame river system
 Ommit including the Cargo Ship

•Underwater Labs:
 Hollow out existing lakes and put them in the lakes
 Turn map into island for Vanilla type spawning

•Bradley Spawn:
 Path

More To Come...
