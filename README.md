Map Version To Be Developed:
<br/>
-Battle Royal
<br/>
-Survival
<br/>

Survival version could stem off the BR version but add in a custom subway underground or trading posts/ custom monuments to compensate for the missing Rust Vanilla ones.

Design choices to be made:
<br/>
•Cargo Ship:
<br/>
 -Turn map into island for Cargo Ship spawn
 <br/>
 -Cut out entrance/exit for Cargo Ship and have it follow the ingame river system
 <br/>
 -Ommit including the Cargo Ship
 <br/>

•Underwater Labs:
<br/>
 -Hollow out existing lakes and put them in the lakes
 <br/>
 -Turn map into island for Vanilla type spawning
 <br/>

•Bradley Spawn:
<br/>
 -Path
<br/>

More To Come...
