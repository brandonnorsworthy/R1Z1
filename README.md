Map Version To Be Developed:
<br/>
-Battle Royal
<br/>
-Survival
<br/>

Survival version could stem off the BR version to cut on dev time. Would add in a custom subway underground, trading posts/custom monuments to compensate for the missing Rust Vanilla ones, or really whatever. Design choices to be made plus ones not listed.

Design choices to be made:
<br/>
•Cargo Ship: (Pick One)
<br/>
 -Turn map into an island for vanilla style Cargo Ship spawn
 <br/>
 -Cut out entrance/exit for Cargo Ship and have it follow the ingame river system
 <br/>
 -Ommit including the Cargo Ship
 <br/>

•Underwater Labs: (Pick One)
<br/>
 -Hollow out existing lakes and put them in the lakes
 <br/>
 -Turn map into an island for Vanilla type spawning of labs
 <br/>

•Bradley Spawn:
<br/>
 -Path
<br/>

More To Come...
